# ToiletHub

This was a 20-day project to develop an mvp, with interaction between classes and at least one completed CRUD + L.

The ToiletHub idea becomes from difficulties which we have found searching for toilets on our vacations.

The project was developed with PHP on server-side, using PHPUnit lib for automated tests. On the client-side, we did use JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Just the basic! 😅

That's all for now, thank you for your attention!
